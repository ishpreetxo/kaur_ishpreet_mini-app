# Mini Car Project
Welcome to the Mini Car Project! This website allows users to find out information about cars by simply clicking on them. It is built using HTML, Sass and Vue.js.
## Aim of the Project
Using SASS, Vue, AJAX, and the Fetch API create a dynamic one-page mini app. Click on one of the Mini models to show more content / data about that model. Navigate around in the app using Vue lifecycle hooks, components, and AJAX where appropriate.
